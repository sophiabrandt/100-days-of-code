# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment

### _I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days._

#### Start Date

February 5th, 2019

## Additional Rules

1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

_(Please note: I've adapted the rules to my circumstances - learning new things with tutorials will still count as progress as long as I push code to github)._
