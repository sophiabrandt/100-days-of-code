The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on February 5, Tuesday, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1

Continued with the Functional Comments frontend app. Added the delete function. Tried to get axios and dispatch for HTTP calls working to init the "database" with a call to a free API. WIP.
[Functional Comments](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/functional-comments)

### R1D2

Continued Functional Comments app - couldn't get initial API call working. I need to re-check my understanding of Promises. [Deployed app with results so far.](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/functional-comments/)
Worked on my [minimal webpack babel boilerplate](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/minimal-webpack-babel-setup). I would like to add hashing for CSS and Javascript but that doesn't work yet. _(Update: got it working)_

### R1D3

Started Functional Movie Search frontend app - uses the same template as [Functional Comments](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/functional-comments/). The goal is to create a simple movie search with the OMDb API and display the result as cards. Couldn't get the API call working yet.

### R1D18

Frustrating day with setting up personal portfolio site with hugo and netlify - tons of errors because of a bug with netlify.  
Worked a bit with Node.js and Elixir.

### R1D19

[Elixir](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir) course and working on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky).

Learning about Flexbox and Grid with [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/).

### R1D21

Tried an "easy" leetcode algorithm but wasn't in the right headspace. Couldn't solve it and have to come back later.  
Worked on Fullstack JS app [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky): added Stripe to backend and frontend.  
Followed the [Elixir course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir).

### R1D22

Heroku Deployment Woes with my Node.js/React.js app. But I managed to get it working (play nice with yarn and environmental variables). Worked a bit with Elixir and Phoenix and eex files (template syntax looks ugly).  
I'm a bit confused about Elixir's data structures: tuples, keyword lists, maps, structs, etc. Why Keyword Lists?
