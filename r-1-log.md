The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on February 5, Tuesday, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1

Continued with the Functional Comments frontend app. Added the delete function. Tried to get axios and dispatch for HTTP calls working to init the "database" with a call to a free API. WIP.
[Functional Comments](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/functional-comments)

### R1D2

Continued Functional Comments app - couldn't get initial API call working. I need to re-check my understanding of Promises. [Deployed app with results so far.](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/functional-comments/)
Worked on my [minimal webpack babel boilerplate](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/minimal-webpack-babel-setup). I would like to add hashing for CSS and Javascript but that doesn't work yet. _(Update: got it working)_

### R1D3

Started Functional Movie Search frontend app - uses the same template as [Functional Comments](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/functional-comments/). The goal is to create a simple movie search with the OMDb API and display the result as cards. Couldn't get the API call working yet.

Followed the [Elixir course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir).

### R1D22

Heroku Deployment Woes with my Node.js/React.js app. But I managed to get it working (play nice with yarn and environmental variables). Worked a bit with Elixir and Phoenix and eex files (template syntax looks ugly).  
I'm a bit confused about Elixir's data structures: tuples, keyword lists, maps, structs, etc. Why Keyword Lists?

### R1D23

I updated one of my components in [https://github.com/sophiabrandt/url-shortener-react](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/url-shortener-react) to Hooks. It's always harder to get something working in an existing app than from a fresh tutorial...  
One of the best resources I found was a blog post by Robin Wieruch: [How to fetch data with React Hooks?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/).

### R1D24

Further refactored [URL Shortener React](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/url-shortener-react) to use Hooks instead of state and class component. I was first on the wrong path with trying to use a `useEffect` Hook when a `useState` Hook was enough.  
I learned more about Elixir and Phoenix.  
I worked on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky) (Node.js/Express.js).

### R1D25

Some Elixir testing with ExUnit. A bit of Phoenix (seems daunting).  
I worked on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky) (Node.js/Express.js).

### R1D26

Trying to wrap my head around algorithms/data structures/sorting algorithms.  
Working on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky) (Node.js/Express.js).  
Some Elixir/Phoenix (Pub/Sub channel).

### R1D27

Poking around Clojure and getting frustrated with its tooling.  
Working on Elixir/Phoenix.  
Working on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky) (Node.js/Express.js).

### R1D28

Worked on Algorithms ([Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)).  
Worked on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky) (Node.js/Express.js).  
Learned about authentication in Elixir/Phoenix.  
Started using Vim.

### R1D29

More playing around with Vim/Neovim - watched some Youtube videos to get a better sense on what's possible.  
Worked on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky) (Node.js/Express.js).  
Worked on oAuth with Elixir/Phoenix.

### R1D30

Mostly wrangling with Vim.  
Some work on [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky).  
Some Elixir/Phoenix.

### R1D31

Mostly fiddling around with [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).  
Some work with Elixir/Phonix. Reading the book [Programming Elixir 1.6](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6). Trying to wrap my head around GenServers and OTP.

### R1D32

I really like Vim keybindings, but I'm not happy with any of the "geeky" solutions (Vim/Neovim, Spacemacs, SpaceVim). [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/) seems like the easiest to get started with - it does the heavy lifting of setting up sane defaults. On the other hand, it comes pre-configured with some things that I don't like. And I haven't figured out how to change that.  
To get at least _some_ work done, I'll switch back to VS Code, but will continue to experiment with SpaceVim and Spacemacs.  
I managed to continue with my Phoenix app (Plugs).

### R1D33

SpaceVim was too heavily customized to my liking. I'm slowly becoming friends with Neovim in my st terminal with tmux wrapper (Manjaro Linux).  
Continued with Elixir app (websockets).

### R1D34

[Learning more about Vim](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/vim) and working on Elixir app (websockets).

### R1D35

More Elixir websockets and Vim (see above).

### R1D36

[Today I learned about `bashrc` and PATH](https://www.rockyourcode.com/bash-and-path). I also continued with Phoenix app (websockets).  
I fiddled around with NeoVim. I uploaded my [dotfiles](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/dotfiles).

### R1D37

I continued my (Neo)Vim journey and learned something useful about text objects.  
I finished the Elixir/Phoenix Udemy course.  
I continued with [feedbacky](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky).  
I created a [FieldArray](https://redux-form.com/8.1.0/examples/fieldarrays/) and realized that you can't use Ramda's `map` to create a JSX tag because `Functions are not valid as a React child`.
[You can use a parent div and use a standard JS `map` function inside that div though](https://github.com/sophiabrandt/feedbacky/commit/40d2c2887a35e6020fa7dcd150f2803670176f4d).

### R1D38

I practiced my (Neo)Vim skills and understanding and set up language support for TypeScript and Clojure/ClojureScript.  
I started with the [egghead.io course **Up and Running with TypeScript**](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-typescript).  
I learned how to serve Markdown files with Elixir.

### R1D39

I finished [egghead.io course **Up and Running with TypeScript**](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-typescript). This only gives you a small taste of TypeScript.  
Started the [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) TypeScript workshop. Very interesting.  
Switched Neovim plugin for Typescript to [nvim-typescript](https://github.com/mhartington/nvim-typescript).

Watched **[Just Enough Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/just-enough-functional-programming-in-javascript)**.  
A first peek at Dart.

### R1D47

Learned a bit more about Dart. I like it so far, it looks like a better OOP-class based JavaScript - with a better standard library and reactive programming out of the box.  
I fought with installing Android Studio and AVD Manager on my machine.  
I learned about Elixir's data structures.

### R1D48

Continued with Dart and Elixir. Both very interesting languages with _very different_ paradigms (object-oriented vs. functional).  
I learned a bit about React Hooks but haven't solidified my knowledge yet. But the examples look interesting.

### R1D49

Continued with Elixir course and learned some things about building APIs. Continued with TypeScript.

### R1D50

Found a good basic course on Udemy for TypeScript: [Typescript with modern React (i.e. hooks, context, suspense)](https://www.rockyourcode.com/surprisingly-good-free-type-script-udemy-course).  
I followed along and brushed up on different React concepts like HOC, React Hooks (state reducer), etc.

I continued with [Elixir for Programmers](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers). I really like how modular the code is - this is what I love about functional programming: small, decoupled units. The course is also a look at how to build programs and I can totally recommend it.
